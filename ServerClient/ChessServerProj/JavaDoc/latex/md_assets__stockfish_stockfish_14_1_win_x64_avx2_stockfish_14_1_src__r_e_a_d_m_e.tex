\href{https://stockfishchess.org}{\texttt{ Stockfish}} is a free, powerful UCI chess engine derived from Glaurung 2.\+1. \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-\/compatible graphical user interface (GUI) (e.\+g. XBoard with Poly\+Glot, Scid, Cute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in order to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} with it.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} engine features two evaluation functions for chess, the classical evaluation based on handcrafted terms, and the NNUE evaluation based on efficiently updatable neural networks. The classical evaluation runs efficiently on almost all CPU architectures, while the NNUE evaluation benefits from the vector intrinsics available on most CPUs ( sse2, avx2, neon, or similar).\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Files}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard protocol used to communicate with a chess engine, and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces (GUI) or chess tools. \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} implements the majority of it options as described in \href{https://www.shredderchess.com/download/div/uci.zip}{\texttt{ the UCI protocol}}.

Developers can see the default values for UCI options available in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} by typing {\ttfamily ./stockfish uci} in a terminal, but the majority of users will typically see them and change them via a chess GUI. This is a list of available UCI options in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \#\#\#\# Threads The number of CPU threads used for searching a position. For best performance, set this equal to the number of CPU cores available.
\item \#\#\#\# Hash The size of the hash table in MB. It is recommended to set Hash after setting Threads.
\item \#\#\#\# Clear Hash Clear the hash table.
\item \#\#\#\# Ponder Let \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} ponder its next move while the opponent is thinking.
\item \#\#\#\# Multi\+PV Output the N best lines (principal variations, PVs) when searching. Leave at 1 for best performance.
\item \#\#\#\# Use NNUE Toggle between the NNUE and classical evaluation functions. If set to \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}, the network parameters must be available to load from file (see also Eval\+File), if they are not embedded in the binary.
\item \#\#\#\# Eval\+File The name of the file of the NNUE evaluation parameters. Depending on the GUI the filename might have to include the full path to the folder/directory that contains the file. Other locations, such as the directory that contains the binary and the working directory, are also searched.
\item \#\#\#\# UCI\+\_\+\+Analyse\+Mode An option handled by your GUI.
\item \#\#\#\# UCI\+\_\+\+Chess960 An option handled by your GUI. If true, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} will play Chess960.
\item \#\#\#\# UCI\+\_\+\+Show\+WDL If enabled, show approximate WDL DBResponse as part of the engine output. These WDL numbers model expected game outcomes for a given evaluation and game ply for engine self-\/play at fishtest LTC conditions (60+0.\+6s per game).
\item \#\#\#\# UCI\+\_\+\+Limit\+Strength Enable weaker play aiming for an Elo rating as set by UCI\+\_\+\+Elo. This option overrides Skill Level.
\item \#\#\#\# UCI\+\_\+\+Elo If enabled by UCI\+\_\+\+Limit\+Strength, aim for an engine strength of the given Elo. This Elo rating has been calibrated at a time control of 60s+0.6s and anchored to CCRL 40/4.
\item \#\#\#\# Skill Level Lower the Skill Level in order to make \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} play weaker (see also UCI\+\_\+\+Limit\+Strength). Internally, Multi\+PV is enabled, and with a certain probability depending on the Skill Level a weaker move will be played.
\item \#\#\#\# Syzygy\+Path Path to the folders/directories storing the Syzygy tablebase files. Multiple directories are to be separated by \char`\"{};\char`\"{} on Windows and by \char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{} on Unix-\/based operating systems. Do not use spaces around the \char`\"{};\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}.

Example\+: {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}tablebases\textbackslash{}wdl345;C\+:\textbackslash{}tablebases\textbackslash{}wdl6;D\+:\textbackslash{}tablebases\textbackslash{}dtz345;D\+:\textbackslash{}tablebases\textbackslash{}dtz6}

It is recommended to store .rtbw files on an SSD. There is no loss in storing the .rtbz files on a regular HD. It is recommended to verify all md5 checksums of the downloaded tablebase files ({\ttfamily md5sum -\/c checksum.\+md5}) as corruption will lead to engine crashes.
\item \#\#\#\# Syzygy\+Probe\+Depth Minimum remaining search depth for which a position is probed. Set this option to a higher value to probe less aggressively if you experience too much slowdown (in terms of nps) due to tablebase probing.
\item \#\#\#\# Syzygy50\+Move\+Rule Disable to let fifty-\/move rule draws detected by Syzygy tablebase probes count as wins or losses. This is useful for ICCF correspondence games.
\item \#\#\#\# Syzygy\+Probe\+Limit Limit Syzygy tablebase probing to positions with at most this many pieces left (including kings and pawns).
\item \#\#\#\# Move Overhead Assume a time delay of x ms due to network and GUI overheads. This is useful to avoid losses on time in those cases.
\item \#\#\#\# Slow Mover Lower values will make \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} take less time in games, higher values will make it think longer.
\item \#\#\#\# nodestime Tells the engine to use nodes searched instead of wall time to account for elapsed time. Useful for engine testing.
\item \#\#\#\# Debug Log File Write all communication to and from the engine into a text file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For developers the following non-\/standard commands might be of interest, mainly useful for debugging\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \#\#\#\# bench {\itshape tt\+Size threads limit fen\+File limit\+Type eval\+Type} Performs a standard benchmark using various options. The signature of a version (standard node count) is obtained using all defaults. {\ttfamily bench} is currently {\ttfamily bench 16 1 13 default depth mixed}.
\item \#\#\#\# compiler Give information about the compiler and environment used for building a binary.
\item \#\#\#\# d Display the current position, with ascii art and fen.
\item \#\#\#\# eval Return the evaluation of the current position.
\item \#\#\#\# export\+\_\+net \mbox{[}filename\mbox{]} Exports the currently loaded network to a file. If the currently loaded network is the embedded network and the filename is not specified then the network is saved to the file matching the name of the embedded network, as defined in \mbox{\hyperlink{evaluate_8h_source}{evaluate.\+h}}. If the currently loaded network is not the embedded network (some net set through the UCI setoption) then the filename parameter is required and the network is saved into that file.
\item \#\#\#\# flip Flips the side to move.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{A note on classical evaluation versus NNUE evaluation}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
Both approaches assign a value to a position that is used in alpha-\/beta (PVS) search to find the best move. The classical evaluation computes this value as a function of various chess concepts, handcrafted by experts, tested and tuned using fishtest. The NNUE evaluation computes this value with a neural network based on basic inputs (e.\+g. piece positions only). The network is optimized and trained on the evaluations of millions of positions at moderate search depth.

The NNUE evaluation was first introduced in shogi, and ported to \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} afterward. It can be evaluated efficiently on CPUs, and exploits the fact that only parts of the neural network need to be updated after a typical chess move. \href{https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish}{\texttt{ The nodchip repository}} provides additional tools to train and develop the NNUE networks. On CPUs supporting modern vector instructions (avx2 and similar), the NNUE evaluation results in much stronger playing strength, even if the nodes per second computed by the engine is somewhat lower (roughly 80\% of nps is typical).

Notes\+:

1) the NNUE evaluation depends on the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} binary and the network parameter file (see the Eval\+File UCI option). Not every parameter file is compatible with a given \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} binary, but the default value of the Eval\+File UCI option is the name of a network that is guaranteed to be compatible with that binary.

2) to use the NNUE evaluation, the additional data file with neural network parameters needs to be available. Normally, this file is already embedded in the binary or it can be downloaded. The filename for the default (recommended) net can be found as the default value of the {\ttfamily Eval\+File} UCI option, with the format {\ttfamily nn-\/\mbox{[}SHA256 first 12 digits\mbox{]}.nnue} (for instance, {\ttfamily nn-\/c157e0a5755b.\+nnue}). This file can be downloaded from

replacing {\ttfamily \mbox{[}filename\mbox{]}} as needed.\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{What to expect from the Syzygy tablebases?}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
If the engine is searching a position that is not in the tablebases (e.\+g. a position with 8 pieces), it will access the tablebases during the search. If the engine reports a very large score (typically 153.\+xx), this means it has found a winning line into a tablebase position.

If the engine is given a position to search that is in the tablebases, it will use the tablebases at the beginning of the search to preselect all good moves, i.\+e. all moves that preserve the win or preserve the draw while taking into account the 50-\/move rule. It will then perform a search only on those moves. {\bfseries{The engine will not move immediately}}, unless there is only a single good move. {\bfseries{The engine likely will not report a mate score, even if the position is known to be won.}}

It is therefore clear that this behaviour is not identical to what one might be used to with Nalimov tablebases. There are technical reasons for this difference, the main technical reason being that Nalimov tablebases use the DTM metric ( distance-\/to-\/mate), while the Syzygy tablebases use a variation of the DTZ metric (distance-\/to-\/zero, zero meaning any move that resets the 50-\/move counter). This special metric is one of the reasons that the Syzygy tablebases are more compact than Nalimov tablebases, while still storing all information needed for optimal play and in addition being able to take into account the 50-\/move rule.\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Large Pages}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} supports large pages on Linux and Windows. Large pages make the hash access more efficient, improving the engine speed, especially on large hash sizes. Typical increases are 5..10\% in terms of nodes per second, but speed increases up to 30\% have been measured. The support is automatic. \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} attempts to use large pages when available and will fall back to regular memory allocation when this is not the case.\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Support on Linux}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
Large page support on Linux is obtained by the Linux kernel transparent huge pages functionality. Typically, transparent huge pages are already enabled, and no configuration is needed.\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Support on Windows}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
The use of large pages requires \char`\"{}\+Lock Pages in Memory\char`\"{} privilege. See \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows}{\texttt{ Enable the Lock Pages in Memory Option (Windows)}} on how to enable this privilege, then run \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap}{\texttt{ RAMMap}} to double-\/check that large pages are used. We suggest that you reboot your computer after you have enabled large pages, because long Windows sessions suffer from memory fragmentation, which may prevent \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} from getting large pages\+: a fresh session is better in this regard.\hypertarget{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Compiling Stockfish yourself from the sources}\label{md_assets__stockfish_stockfish_14_1_win_x64_avx2_stockfish_14_1_src__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} has support for 32 or 64-\/bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions, big-\/endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.

On Unix-\/like systems, it should be easy to compile \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_stockfish}{Stockfish}} directly from the source code with the included Makefile in the folder {\ttfamily src}. In general it is recommended to run {\ttfamily make help} to see a list of make targets with corresponding descriptions.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd src}
\DoxyCodeLine{make help}
\DoxyCodeLine{make net}
\DoxyCodeLine{make build ARCH=x86-\/64-\/modern}

\end{DoxyCode}


When not using the Makefile to compile (for instance, with Microsoft MSVC) you need to manually set/unset some switches in the compiler command line; see file {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{types_8h_source}{types.\+h}}} for a quick reference.
